# save-it-for-later-extension

This extension is built for chrome to work with the iOS Save It For Later app.

Using the same account to sign into both will allow you to simply click the button when you are on a page, and it will save into your phone for later viewing.

Later this will be able to show a list via the extension instead of solely viewing on the app.

copy the config_example.js to config.js and add the firebase variables to allow the extension to work with the application.
